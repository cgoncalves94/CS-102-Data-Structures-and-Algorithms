# Restaurant_Recommendation
Welcome to my portfolio project for CS 102: Data Structures and Algorithms! In this project, I'm developing a Restaurant Recommendation Engine. This console-based application sorts and searches restaurant data to provide personalized recommendations. It features algorithms for sorting by ratings and searching by cuisine or location.
