# Restaurant Recommendation Engine

## Introduction

Welcome to my portfolio project for CS 102: Data Structures and Algorithms! In this project, I've developed a Restaurant Recommendation Engine. This console-based application sorts and searches restaurant data to provide personalized recommendations. The restaurant data is stored in and retrieved from a JSON file. The application features algorithms for sorting by ratings and searching by cuisine or location.

## How To Use

The application is menu-driven and can be navigated using numbered choices:

1. View Recommendations
2. Add a Review
3. Search Restaurants
4. Exit

## Prerequisites

To run this application, you need Python 3.12 installed. If you don't have Python installed, download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation and Running the Application

1. Clone this repository by copying the URL and using it with your preferred Git client.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `app.py` file.
3. To run the application, execute `python3 app.py` in the terminal.

## Features and Objectives

The primary features and objectives achieved in this project are:

1. **Data Storage**: Restaurant and review data are stored in a JSON file, which is read into the application at runtime.
2. **Data Structures**: Utilized Python lists and dictionaries to manage restaurant and review data.
3. **Sorting Algorithms**: Implemented quicksort for sorting restaurants by various attributes.
4. **Searching Algorithms**: Used binary search to find restaurants by cuisine.
5. **File I/O**: JSON files are used for data storage and retrieval, making the system extendable and maintainable.

## Technologies and Concepts Used

- **Python 3**: The entire project is developed using Python 3.
- **Git Version Control**: Used Git for version control to keep track of progress and changes.
- **JSON**: Used for data storage and retrieval.
- **Algorithms**: Quicksort and binary search algorithms are implemented.

## Code Structure

The project is divided into the following Python files:

- `app.py`: Main application file containing the menu and control flow logic.
- `sorts.py`: Contains sorting algorithms.
- `searches.py`: Contains search algorithms.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for data manipulation and display.

## Conclusion

This project was an excellent opportunity to solidify my understanding of data structures and algorithms while building something practical and useful. By using Git for version control, I was able to manage the project efficiently.
